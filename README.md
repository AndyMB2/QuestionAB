# questionAB
question.py is a python program that will be able to do 6 things. 
The 1st thing that this program can achieve is that is is able to ask a 4 multiple choice 
question. It can also get the answer that the user inputs and check if the answer is 
acceptable or not. If the input is not an int and an invalid answer then the program will
repeat it's self until the user submits an acceptable response. The program also give the 
user feedback if the user submits a invalid response. Not only that but it can also keep
and show the user the score when the program is over.
